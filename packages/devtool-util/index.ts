// Note: Do not put this file inside `/packages/devtool-util/src/`
// This package could not be resolved by node resolution algorithm inside this monorepo
// if specified "package.json#main" as "src/index.js" due to the file extension.
// So the workaround is to put "index.ts" at the package root directory, so "@pinnacle0/devtool-util"
// resolves to "index.ts" inside this monorepo, and resolves to "index.js" if this package is
// downloaded from NPM registry as a node_module.
